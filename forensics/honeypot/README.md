# Forensics :: Honeypot

```
Santa really encourages people to be at his good list but sometimes he is a bit naughty himself. He is using a Windows 7 honeypot to capture any suspicious action. Since he is not a forensics expert, can you help him identify any indications of compromise?

1. Find the full URL used to download the malware.
2. Find the malicious's process ID.
3. Find the attackers IP

Flag Format: HTB{echo -n "http://url.com/path.foo_PID_127.0.0.1" | md5sum}
```
